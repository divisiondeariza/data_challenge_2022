    "February, March, and December had the fastest growth rates of 375%, 117%, and 99% respectively. September, October, and November had the lowest growth rates of 3%, 13%, and 37% respectively. It appears as though the product issues occurred in September, as this is the only month where we observe the NPS score dropping (from 66 to 46). This appears to have had a large effect on customer growth, as September had the only single-figure growth rate (3%), which took 2 - 3 months to recover."
